[中文介绍](#火柴人动画分析)
I made this for YUSS's 37th sports meeting. Our teacher wanted us(about 1000 students) to make some pictures on the sports field with colored fans for the grade performance.
Originally, for every every 40 students, 2 students were in charge of converting the picture(which is a set of ~20 colored bitmaps) to the list of colors a student had to show
(which is an ordered list of 20 colors). That process was not only boring, time-consuming, but also risky(if you got one wrong, you would be criticized by name in front of the whole grade.
The teacher also changes this cartoon almost every day!  
However, I was one of the 52 poor students. Then I chose to automate the process with Python. I started learning python-docx, python-pptx that day, and finished the development in ~1,5
days. After that, the whole grade were freed by this program.  
In the end, out grade made a great success in this performance.

# 火柴人动画分析
在云大附中第37届运动会的开幕式表演上，我们年级的表演之一是让我们1000多个同学在球场上翻一个有不同颜色的扇子，来表现出一个动画。老师的设计稿是一个PPT，每一页是一个彩色点阵。一开始，
每个班的40名学生中就有两位得将这个设计稿“翻译”成每一个同学翻扇子的顺序表，而我就是其中之一（当时我们被叫做“密码员”）。这个过程不仅单调耗时，还风险很大（每天都是年级组长监督训练，假如翻译错了，
就是全年级点名批评）。老师还几乎每天都要修改。  
所以我就决定使用Python来解决这个工作。之后，我学习使用了python-docx，python-pptx，然后用大概一天半完成了这个程序。这样，就“解放”了52个同学。  
最后，我们的表演很成功。
